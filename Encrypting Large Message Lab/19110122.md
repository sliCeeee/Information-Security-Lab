## 4.1. Encrypt and Decrypt Text file

Create text file named plain.txt with whatever content.

- Encrypt file plain.txt in aes-256 bit in ecb.

Then we have file ecb_encrypted.txt

View the encrypted file with xxd.

- Decrypt file ecb_encrypted.txt

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image5.png" alt="image1" width="726">

We have file ecb_decrypted.txt which has the same content with file plaint.txt before encrypted.

- Encrypt file plain.txt in aes-256 bit in cbc.

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image7.png" alt="image1" width="726">

Then we have file cbc_encrypted.txt

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image8.png" alt="image1" width="726">

View the encrypted file with xxd.

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image9.png" alt="image1" width="726">

- Decrypt file ecb_encrypted.txt.

## 4.2. Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC

Download file whale.bmp and save as origin.bmp

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image12.png" alt="image1" width="726">

Encrypt the file using the ECB and CBC modes.

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image13.png" alt="image1" width="726">

Split the origin.bmp file into the header and body parts using the dd command.

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image14.png" alt="image1" width="726">

Encrypt the Body using ECB and CBC Modes.

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image15.png" alt="image1" width="726">

Combine the Header with the Encrypted Body.

View both encrypted picture: ecb_partially_encrypted.bmp and cbc_partially_encrypted.bmp

Observations:

- ECB Mode: Typically, the ECB mode will show a more discernible pattern in the encrypted image. This is because ECB encrypts each block of the image independently, so identical blocks in the image will encrypt to identical blocks in the ciphertext. As a result, the structure and patterns of the original image may still be visible.

- CBC Mode: The CBC mode will likely obscure the image much more effectively. Since CBC mode uses an IV and chains the encryption of each block with the previous one, the patterns from the original image are less likely to be visible. This results in a more randomized and less recognizable image.

Explanation of Observation:

- ECB Mode: The patterns in the original image are still visible because ECB mode does not randomize identical plaintext blocks. This can lead to visible artifacts in the encrypted image that resemble the structure of the original picture.

- CBC Mode: The image appears more randomized and less recognizable because CBC mode uses an IV and each block is dependent on the previous block, which introduces a diffusion effect that obscures the original patterns more effectively.
