# Lab 1: Buffer Overflow

## Task 1: Stack smashing by memory overwritten

## 1.1. bof1.c

First, I installed the program bof1.c into nano.

![alt text](images/image1.1.1.png)

Then I run the command line _"gcc -g bof1.c -o bof1.out -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2"_ to compile the program and as shown in the picture there is no error.

![alt text](images/image1.1.2.png)

In order for the program to print the result _"code flow has been modified"_ we must find the address of the _"change"_ function, so I go to gdb and use the _"disas change" _ command to find the address of the function.

![alt text](images/image1.1.3.png)

We see the function _"secretFunc"_ has the address 0x0804846b.

Then I exited gdb and entered the command _"python -c print 'a'\*204 + \x6b\x84\x04\x08'" | ./bof1.out"_ to see the output of the program.

Command explanation:

- " python -c "print 'a'\*204 : In this statement I assign the buffer memory area with a value consisting of 204 letters 'a'.
- "+'\x6b\x84\x04\x08'" : In this statement, I add the address of the change function but write the opposite because in the memory area, the low byte is first, the high byte is after. (So '6b' is the lowest byte that should come first, followed in turn '84', '04', '08').

![alt text](images/image1.1.5.png)

Explanation of printing 204 characters a: Because the Buffer occupies 200 memory cells in the memory area + 4 memory cells of the frame pointer.

We observe the results:

## 1.2. bof2.c

First, I installed the program bof2.c into nano.

![alt text](images/image1.2.1.png)

Then I run the command line _"gcc -g bof2.c -o bof2.out -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2"_ to compile the program.

![alt text](images/image1.2.2.png)

In this article the result can have 2 cases:

- Case 1: You are on right way!

In order for the program to print the result _"You are on right way!"_, I genarate a buffer overflow supported by fgets with 40byte and 4 random bytes.

I entered the command _"python -c print 'a'\*40 + \x23\x06\x01\x20'" | ./bof2.out"_.

![alt text](images/image1.2.3.png)

With \x23\x06\x01\x20 is random value.

Command explanation:

- " python -c "print 'a'\*40 : In this statement I assign the buffer memory area with a value consisting of 40 letters 'a'.
- "+'\x23\x06\x01\x20'" : In this statement, I added random bytes to change the value of the check variable, thus satisfying the condition of the first if line.

We observe the results:

![alt text](images/image1.2.4.png)

- Case 2: Yeah! You win!

In order for the program to print the result _"Yeah!You win!"_, I genarate a buffer overflow supported by fgets with 40byte and 4 bytes with pattern "deadbeef".

I entered the command "python -c print 'a'\*40 + \xef\xbe\xad\xde'" | ./bof2.out".

![alt text](images/image1.2.5.png)

Command explanation:

- " python -c "print 'a'\*40 : In this statement I assign the buffer memory area with a value consisting of 40 letters 'a'.
- "+'\xef\xbe\xad\xde'" : In this statement, I added 4 bytes with patter "deadbeef" to change the value of the check variable, however in the memory area, the low byte is first, the high byte is after. (So 'ef' is the lowest byte that should come first, followed in turn 'be', 'ad', 'de').

We observe the results:

## 1.3. bof3.c

First, I installed the program bof3.c into nano.

![alt text](images/image1.3.1.png)

Then I run the command line _"gcc -g bof3.c -o bof3.out -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2"_ to compile the program.

![alt text](images/image1.3.2.png)

In order for the program to print the result _"Congrat"_, we must find the address of the _"sup"_ function, so I go to gdb and use the _"disas sup"_ command to find the address of the function.

![alt text](images/image1.3.3.png)

We see the function _"change"_ has the address 0x0804846e.

Then I exited gdb and entered the command _"./bof3.out $(python -c "print('a'\*136+'\x6e\x84\x04\x08')")"_ to see the output of the program.

![alt text](images/image1.3.4.png)

Command explanation:

- " $(python -c "print('a'\*136 " : In this statement I assign the buffer memory area with a value consisting of 136 letters 'a'.
- "+'\x6e\x84\x04\x08'" : In this statement, I add the address of the change function but write the opposite because in the memory area, the low byte is first, the high byte is after. (So '6e' is the lowest byte that should come first, followed in turn '84', '04', '08').

![alt text](images/image1.3.5.png)

Explanation of printing 136 characters a: Because the Buf occupies 128 memory cells in the memory area + 4 memory cells of the var variable + 4 memory cells of the frame pointer.

We observe the results:

## Task 2:

First, I installed the program file_del.asm into nano.

![alt text](images/image2.1.png)

_Step 1:_ Prepare the environment for the attack

- Compile the program vuln with the command gcc with no stack protector and some assembly code beautify referrence.
- Turn off aslr.
- Creat link to zsh instead of default dash to turn off bash countermeasures.

![alt text](images/image2.2.png)

_Step 2:_ Compile file file_del.asm and create shell code

![alt text](images/image2.3.png)

_Note:_ Compute the distance between buffer (esp) and return address to determine the padding bytes will be injected along with the shellcode.
64 + 4 -36 =32 ('a' bytes)

- 64 bytes of buf
- 4 bytes of ebp
- 36 bytes of shellcode

_Step 3:_ Executing file deletion attack with shellcode in gdb

- Put breakpoint below esp to see shellcode observation.

![alt text](images/image2.4.png)

- Then I installed shellcode in the program to observe the results.

![alt text](images/image2.5.png)

- I use command x/80xb $esp to watch the stack memory from esp.

![alt text](images/image2.6.png)

I see that after byte \x0a\ the following bytes are not assigned to the program and the shellcode behind is completely gone.

- After searching for information about writing shellcode, I found out how to eliminate \x0a\ and \x00\ (zero) from my shellcode.

![alt text](images/image2.7.png)

So I proceeded to rewrite the assembly code.

![alt text](images/image2.8.png)

Then I do a re-compile to get a new shellcode.

![alt text](images/image2.9.png)

I see \x0a\x00 has dissappeard.

I perform the attack once more.

_Result:_

![alt text](images/image2.10.png)

Trying testing our modified shellcode by creating new dummyfile and delete it.

![alt text](images/image2.11.png)

**_I have created and deleted dummyfile successfully._**
