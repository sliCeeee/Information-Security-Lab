# Firewall Lab

## a. Setup rules on router to block all access into it except ping

<u>First rule:</u> Allow ICMP (ping) packets to pass through the router.

<i>$ docker exec -it router iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT</i>

Command explanation:

- docker exec: This is the command Docker uses to execute a command inside a running Docker container.
- -it: This is an option of the docker exec command to set up an interactive environment (interactive mode) and attach it to the container so you can interact with it via the command line. This option stands for --interactive and --tty.
- router: This is the name of the Docker container you want to execute the command inside.
- iptables: This is the iptables command, a command line tool in Linux systems used to configure firewalls on containers.
- -A INPUT: This is an iptables option to add a rule to the INPUT chain. The INPUT string is one of the strings against which the data packet arriving at the server will be inspected.
- -p icmp: This is an iptables option to specify the protocol as ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). ICMP is commonly used for pings and network-related notifications.
- -j ACCEPT: This is the iptables option to define the action to be taken when a data packet matches this rule. In this case, this rule will accept (ACCEPT) any ICMP packets, allowing them to pass through the firewall.

So, the above statement is adding a rule to the firewall INPUT string in the Docker container whose name is "router". This rule allows all ICMP (ping) packets to pass through this container's firewall.

<u>Second rule:</u> Block all other traffic to the router

<i>$ docker exec -it router iptables -A INPUT -j DROP</i>

Command explanation:

- docker exec: This is the command Docker uses to execute a command inside a running Docker container.
- -it: This is an option of the docker exec command to set up an interactive environment (interactive mode) and attach it to the container so you can interact with it via the command line. This option stands for --interactive and --tty.
- router: This is the name of the Docker container you want to execute the command inside.
- iptables: This is the iptables command, a command line tool in Linux systems used to configure firewalls on containers.
- -A INPUT: This is an iptables option to add a rule to the INPUT chain. The INPUT string is one of the strings against which the data packet arriving at the server will be inspected.
- -j DROP: This is an iptables option that defines the action to be taken when a data packet matches this rule. In this case, this rule will perform a "DROP" action, which means rejecting the entire packet arriving at the INPUT chain. This means that all data packets arriving at the router will be rejected and not processed or accepted.

So the above statement is adding a rule to the INPUT chain of the firewall in the Docker container named "router". This rule will deny any packets arriving at this container, disallowing any connection or access to the container via the INPUT chain.

## b. Setup rules on router to prevent computers on subnet 10.9.0.0/24 from accessing the internal web server(iweb).

After executing the above command, I ping a packet from the inner source machine with IP address 172.16.10.100 to the badsite destination machine with IP address 10.9.0.10, as shown below, this packet must go through The router has IP address 10.9.0.254.

Set up a firewall rule to deny access from the 10.9.0.0/24 subnet to the internal web server (iweb).

<i>$ docker exec -it router iptables -A INPUT -s 10.9.0.0/24 -d 172.16.10.110 -j DROP</i>

Command explanation:

- docker exec: This is the command Docker uses to execute a command inside a running Docker container.
- -it: This is an option of the docker exec command to set up an interactive environment (interactive mode) and attach it to the container so you can interact with it via the command line. This option stands for --interactive and --tty.
- router: This is the name of the Docker container you want to execute the command inside.
- iptables: This is the iptables command, a command line tool in Linux systems used to configure firewalls on containers.
- -A INPUT: This is an iptables option to add a rule to the INPUT chain. The INPUT string is one of the strings against which the data packet arriving at the server will be inspected.
- -j DROP: This is an iptables option that defines the action to be taken when a data packet matches this rule. In this case, this rule will perform a "DROP" action, which means rejecting the entire packet arriving at the INPUT chain. This means that all data packets arriving at the router will be rejected and not processed or accepted.

Run any command (for example, sleep 3600) to keep the container running.

CMD ["sleep", "3600"]

## c. The badsite was found to contain malwares and source of delivering bots. Setup rules on router to stop computers on subnet 172.16.10.0/24 from accessing the badsite.

<i>$ docker exec -it router iptables -A INPUT -s 172.16.10.0/24 -d 10.9.0.10 -j DROP</i>

Command explanation:

- docker exec: This is the command Docker uses to execute a command inside a running Docker container.
- -it: This is an option of the docker exec command to set up an interactive environment (interactive mode) and attach it to the container so you can interact with it via the command line. This option stands for --interactive and --tty.
- router: This is the name of the Docker container you want to execute the command inside.
- iptables: This is the iptables command, a command line tool in Linux systems used to configure firewalls on containers.
- -A INPUT: This is an iptables option to add a rule to the INPUT chain. The INPUT string is one of the strings against which the data packet arriving at the server will be inspected.
- -j DROP: This is an iptables option that defines the action to be taken when a data packet matches this rule. In this case, this rule will perform a "DROP" action, which means rejecting the entire packet arriving at the INPUT chain. This means that all data packets arriving at the router will be rejected and not processed or accepted.
