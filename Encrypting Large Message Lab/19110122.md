## 4.2. Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC

Download file whale.bmp and save as origin.bmp

Encrypt the file using the ECB and CBC modes.

<img src="https://github.com/sliCeeee/Information-Security-Lab/blob/main/Encrypting%20Large%20Message%20Lab/images/image13.png" alt="image13" width="726">

Split the origin.bmp file into the header and body parts using the dd command.

Observations:

- ECB Mode: Typically, the ECB mode will show a more discernible pattern in the encrypted image. This is because ECB encrypts each block of the image independently, so identical blocks in the image will encrypt to identical blocks in the ciphertext. As a result, the structure and patterns of the original image may still be visible.

- CBC Mode: The CBC mode will likely obscure the image much more effectively. Since CBC mode uses an IV and chains the encryption of each block with the previous one, the patterns from the original image are less likely to be visible. This results in a more randomized and less recognizable image.

Explanation of Observation:

- ECB Mode: The patterns in the original image are still visible because ECB mode does not randomize identical plaintext blocks. This can lead to visible artifacts in the encrypted image that resemble the structure of the original picture.

- CBC Mode: The image appears more randomized and less recognizable because CBC mode uses an IV and each block is dependent on the previous block, which introduces a diffusion effect that obscures the original patterns more effectively.

## 4.3. Encryption Mode – Corrupted Cipher Text

Create a text file has at least 64 bytes long.

Encrypt the File using different modes of AES-256 Cipher.

Using the dd command, corrupt the 5th byte in each encrypted file:

- ECB mode:

### a. How much information can you recover?

- ECB Mode: Only the block containing the corrupted bit will be affected. The rest of the file should be recoverable.
- CBC Mode: The block containing the corrupted bit and the subsequent block will be affected. The rest of the file should be recoverable.
- CFB Mode: The block containing the corrupted bit will be affected, with a one-bit error propagating to the subsequent block.
- OFB Mode: Only the corresponding bit in the decrypted plaintext will be affected. The rest of the file should be fully recoverable.

### b. Explanation:

- ECB Mode: Independent encryption of blocks means that corruption is localized to the affected block.
- CBC Mode: Chaining of blocks means that corruption in one block affects the decryption of the current and subsequent block.
- CFB Mode: The feedback mechanism causes errors to propagate, but only slightly.
- OFB Mode: The keystream is independent of the plaintext and ciphertext, meaning only the corresponding bit is affected.

### c. Implication of these differences:

- ECB Mode: Vulnerable to block manipulation and pattern analysis.
- CBC Mode: Better error propagation management than ECB but still limited in security due to block dependency.
- CFB Mode: Limited error propagation, maintaining some resilience in error recovery.
- OFB Mode: Minimal error propagation, making it robust against bit-level corruption but sensitive to initialization issues.
